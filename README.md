# Maize Yield Prediction (SDG 2 – Zero Hunger)

This project uses machine learning to predict maize crop yields 
based on agricultural and environmental data.  
It supports data-driven approaches to improve food security.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Results interpretation

## How to Run
Open the notebook directly in Google Colab:

## Results
- Best model: Random Forest
- Example performance metrics: R² = 0.82 (adjust based on your actual results)
- Key insights: Highlight any trends or features that influence maize yield
